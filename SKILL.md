description: Turn a concept that can be written as one formula — compound interest, a loan's monthly payment, the chance of at least one success — into one self-contained HTML page where every slider shows the formula it changes, written with names and with current numbers, beside the result and a curve, plus practice questions graded on the result, not on how it was reached. Use when someone needs to see how a formula behaves rather than read about it, or when a lesson, post or README needs an interactive example that works offline as one file. scripts/make_explorer.py builds it from a JSON concept, refuses controls that change nothing, questions that omit their values and tolerances that pass a wrong answer, and seals the page to its own scripts; scripts/explorer_check.py checks fourteen rules; scripts/probe_check.py works every slider and question in Chrome with the page's own buttons and recomputes the results in Python.
license: MIT
compatibility: standard library only, no packages and no build step; the page it writes has no dependencies, evaluates its formula without eval, and carries a Content-Security-Policy under which the browser loads nothing from anywhere and runs no code but its own. probe_check.py needs Google Chrome or Chromium; without one, open the page with ?probe=1 in any browser.

# Concept explorer

**A formula is easier to believe once you have moved it.** Read "the amount grows by (1 + r)^n" and it is a
sentence; drag the rate from 5% to 7% and watch the same ten years turn a thousand pounds into £1,967 instead of
£1,629, and it is something you know. The page this skill builds puts every control next to the formula it changes: the
formula written with names, the same formula written with the numbers you have set (the one you just moved is
marked), the result, and a curve along one control. Every line is written from the formula the page computes with,
so what you read is what it calculated.

> **Paths.** Commands in this skill start with `${…SKILL_DIR}`: this skill's own folder, the one that contains this SKILL.md. Claude Code fills it in. If your agent shows the placeholder as written (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others), replace it with that folder's absolute path before you run the command. Left as it is, it expands to nothing and the path breaks.

## When this applies

- Someone asks how a formula behaves — interest, repayments, a probability, a physics or pricing formula — and a
  paragraph of explanation is not landing.
- A lesson, a post or a README needs an example people can move, as one file that opens anywhere without a server.
- The same "what if the rate were higher / the loan shorter / the chance smaller" question keeps being asked.

## Procedure

1. **Pick one formula.** The page explains one formula with one result — not a model, not a derivation. If the
   concept needs two formulas, it is two pages. Write it in the page's small language: numbers, the names of your
   controls, `+ - * /`, `^` for powers, parentheses, and `min max abs sqrt exp ln log10 floor ceil round`
   (`python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/formula.py "P * (1 + r/100)^n" P=1000 r=5 n=10` tries one out).
2. **Write the concept** as JSON. Start from `assets/concepts/compound-interest.json`; every field is described in
   `references/concept-format.md`. One to six controls, each a slider with a label, a unit, a range, a step and a
   starting value; the control the chart runs along; what the formula leaves out and where it comes from.
3. **Choose ranges a person would try.** A rate from 0 to 15%, not from 0 to 100; a loan from one year to 35. The
   starting values are what the page opens on, so make them an ordinary case, not an extreme one.
4. **Write the practice questions.** A *compute* question sets every control and asks for the result. Its prompt
   states every value it uses in numerals, each with its unit (`£2,000`, `3%`, `5 years`) or as `x = -2` — the
   checker pairs every value with a number of its own and refuses a 5 that the prompt gives to another control
   ("3% for 5 years" does not state a 5% rate), and a number that only says how to answer or which question this is
   stands for no value. That is judged by where the number stands, not by a list of phrasings: a label ("Task 2:",
   "Question 3 of 4:", "(Part 2)"), a bracket holding only a count ("(2 marks)", "(4 s.f.)"), or a precision ("to 2
   decimals", "to 4 s.f.", "in 2 lines", "to the nearest 10"); `references/concept-format.md` gives the exact rule. Its tolerance is smaller than the nearest other answer any one slider gives: every position
   of each slider is tried, the others at the question's values, since a curve that turns back can bring a far
   position close. A *reach*
   question fixes all but one or two controls and asks for a setting that meets a goal (at least, at most, or within
   a tolerance of a target); its prompt states the fixed values, the target and a within goal's tolerance the same
   way. Add `"lowest"` or `"highest"` when the question is "the fewest years", "the earliest time", "the highest
   rate": the answer is then the setting with no other position further toward that end that also meets the goal.
5. **Build the page**: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/make_explorer.py concept.json -o page.html`. It checks
   the concept first (E01-E07) and writes nothing when a rule is broken: a control the formula never uses or that
   never changes the result, a starting value between slider positions, a page that would open on an error, a
   question that leaves a control unset or never states a value it uses, a tolerance another answer would pass, a
   reach question nothing passes or that the starting values already pass, a slider position that would show more
   digits than a readout has. The page is the template with your concept in it and the design tokens written in:
   one file, sealed — its Content-Security-Policy names the page's own four scripts by their SHA-256, so the
   browser runs those and nothing else, loads nothing from any file or address, and runs no string as code. While you are still shaping the concept,
   `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/concept.py concept.json` lists the problems without building anything.
6. **Check the file**: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/explorer_check.py page.html` — the concept rules again,
   read back out of the page, plus E08 the formula language is this skill's, unchanged · E09 the page opens with its
   policy, the policy is the one make_explorer.py writes and still matches the page's scripts, and the usual ways a
   page asks for something from outside are named so they can be taken out (an outside address in an attribute or a
   style, a link to any file, srcset, @import, a meta refresh, fetch and the rest; a file next to the page, such as
   src="px.png", is not named — the policy stops the browser loading it) · E10 text written as text, none of the
   usual ways of writing markup from script (innerHTML and the others it lists), and not the name eval anywhere in
   the script · E11 colours from the tokens ·
   E12 no icon characters · E13 a footer that says what is left out, where the formula comes from, and that it is
   not advice · E14 the page reads its concept and carries its probe.
7. **Run it**: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/probe_check.py page.html` opens the page in Chrome with
   `?probe=1`. The page moves every slider, types answers and presses its own Check buttons, and writes what it saw;
   the script recomputes what it recorded with the Python twin: P1 every move changes the formula line, marks the
   moved number and moves the chart · P2 at each state it records (the start, each control at its ends and middle,
   all at their lowest, all at their highest), every formula line, result and readout is exactly what Python writes ·
   P3 compute answers pass written three ways and half a tolerance off, and fail two tolerances off or empty · P4
   reach questions pass and fail on the same settings as Python, lock their fixed controls, and one step past a
   lowest or highest answer fails, as does the first setting further on where a curve that turns back meets the
   goal again. Axis labels, the slider end labels and the verdict texts are not compared; they are the template's. Without Chrome, or where Chrome cannot start (some agent sandboxes do not allow it, and the script says so
   rather than blaming the page), open `page.html?probe=1` in any browser; its own summary is at the foot of the page.
8. **Open it and move everything** — `references/acceptance.md` is the walk-through: what a person checks that no
   script can, such as whether the ranges make sense and whether the notes say what the formula really leaves out.

## Clickable number sources

Click the result or a control's readout and a panel shows where it comes from: for the result, the formula with the
numbers as they are set now (brought up to date after every move) and the concept's notes on what the formula leaves
out; for a readout, the slider's range. The runtime is the page's fourth script, named by its hash in the page's policy
like the other three.

The panel is the shared number-sources layer that nk-design, nk-data-story, nk-deck, nk-model and nk-explorer all
use, the same three files in each (`scripts/numsrc.py`, `assets/numsrc.js`, `assets/numsrc.css`): Tab to a number, Enter
or Space opens it, Esc closes it and puts the focus back; printed, the numbers are plain text. `python3
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/numsrc.py check page.html` checks a page: every marked number has an entry, every entry says
where from, how and what was not checked, and the runtime is the shipped one, byte for byte.

## Rules that keep it honest

- **The formula shown is the formula computed.** All three lines — with names, with numbers, the result — are
  written from one parsed formula. Nobody types the formula text into the page, and a page whose formula language
  differs from this skill's by one character is refused (E08).
- **No eval.** The formula is parsed by a small language that knows only numbers, the page's own controls and a
  fixed list of functions. A name it does not know is an error, not a lookup, so the concept cannot reach anything
  else on the page. The page's policy forbids eval in the browser as well, and lets no other script run.
- **The line with numbers works out.** A number in the formula is written as it was typed, and a negative value in
  brackets (`1 × (-3)^2`, not `1 × -3^2`), so doing the sum on the second line gives the third. The parity run
  checks that on both twins, case by case.
- **round, floor and ceil round what a person gets by hand.** Before they round, they finish their argument's working
  in decimal, exactly, on the numbers as the line with numbers writes them: `round(8.5 × 10.45, 2)` is 88.83 and
  `ceil(2.1 ÷ 0.3)` is 7, where rounding the computer's binary result would give 88.82 and 8. A step with no exact
  decimal result (`sqrt`, `exp`, `ln`, `log10`, a fractional power) is taken as the number the page computes for it.
- **Numbers are shown one way.** Six significant digits, rounded half away from zero on the exact value, the same
  rule in the page and in its Python twin; the probe compares them character for character.
- **Graded on the result.** An answer passes if it is within the tolerance, however it was worked out or written
  (plainly, with more decimals, with its unit). The tolerance itself is checked: one wide enough to pass the nearest
  other answer a slider can give — one step away for most formulas, further for a staircase like `ceil` — cannot
  tell a right reading from a misread one, and is refused.
- **It says what it leaves out.** Every page has notes on what the formula ignores and a line on where it comes
  from, and the footer says it explains a concept and is not advice.

## Boundaries

- **One formula, one result, sliders only.** No systems of equations, no step-by-step derivations, no dropdowns or
  switches. Each control is a number on a grid of at most 2,000 steps, and a page has one to six of them.
- **Formulas only, not code or queries.** A concept that is really a query over a table (GROUP BY, a join) is not
  this version's; a table-and-query kind is planned for 0.2.
- **The chart moves one control and holds the rest where they are.** It is a slice, not a map of everything.
- **Answers are read as plain numbers.** The result's unit, a currency sign and % are removed; commas may only
  separate groups of three digits (2,318.55), and e-notation is read because the page writes very large and very
  small results that way. A decimal comma (2318,55), a misplaced comma (23,18.55) and hex (0x90F) are not numbers
  here: the page says "Type a number."
- **It cannot tell whether the formula fits a case.** The page says where the formula comes from and what it
  leaves out; whether it applies to somebody's own loan or experiment is theirs to judge, and the footer says so.
- **The checks read the page as built, and the policy does not hold every edit.** Tested in Chrome, the page's
  policy stops an outside font, image or stylesheet, an @import and eval, and a script changed without its hash does
  not run. It does not stop: an edit that removes or loosens the policy line (explorer_check.py refuses that page,
  E09); anything placed before the policy line, which makes Chrome ignore the policy (E09 names such a page); a meta
  refresh (E09 names it); a script that navigates away (`location.assign`, `location =`, `window.open`), which
  explorer_check.py does not name; and a script whose hashes are written again after the edit, which then runs.
  Text can be changed to say anything. Run explorer_check.py and probe_check.py again after any edit, or build the
  page again.
- **E10 covers the usual ways of writing markup, not all of them.** It names innerHTML, outerHTML,
  insertAdjacentHTML and the others it lists, written that way; `el["inner" + "HTML"] = …` or `setHTMLUnsafe(…)`
  added to a page with its hashes written again gets no finding.
- **The checkers' own command lines are not break-tested.** The break matrices cover the lines that report a
  finding, not the lines that print the findings and set the exit code, nor explorer_check.py's line that passes on
  concept.py's findings. Changing explorer_check.py's exit code to 0 left every self-test green; a run then prints
  its findings but exits 0.

## Provenance

Own practice, 2026-09. The two ideas at the centre come from [Query Mirror](https://github.com/NickkkLian/SQL-Viz-for-Edu),
a SQL teaching tool of mine: every click on the table becomes the SQL behind it, and practice is graded on the
result set rather than on how the query was written. This skill carries both over to formulas and none of the code.
The formula language, its Python twin, the page's self-test and the rules on questions are new here. The rule that a
tolerance must be tighter than one slider step came from asking what a tolerance is for; the rule that a prompt
states every value it uses came from the easiest mistake to make when writing one — changing a number in the data
and not in the sentence. The appearance comes from the token file shared with the other pages in this family.

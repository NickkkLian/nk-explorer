"""explorer_check.py — check a built nk-explorer page without opening it.

    python3 explorer_check.py page.html [page.html ...]
    python3 explorer_check.py --selftest

First the page's concept block, read back out of the page, against the concept rules (E01-E07, in concept.py —
the same rules make_explorer.py applies before it builds). Then the page itself:
  E08  the formula language in the page is this skill's, unchanged (the text between its markers is formula.js's)
  E09  one file that fetches nothing. The page opens with its own Content-Security-Policy (right after <meta
       charset>), and the browser holds it to that: nothing loaded from any file or address (only data: images), no
       script but the page's own three, named by their SHA-256, and no string run as code. This refuses a page whose
       policy is missing, not first, or not the one make_explorer.py writes, and one whose scripts no longer match
       the hashes. It also names, so they can be taken out, the usual ways a page asks for something from outside —
       any <link>, a script from a file, an outside address in an attribute (src, srcset, href, …) or in the styles,
       an @import, a <meta http-equiv> refresh (a policy cannot stop one), fetch, XMLHttpRequest, sockets, beacons,
       workers and dynamic import. An attribute naming a file next to the page (src="px.png") is not named here;
       the policy stops the browser loading it
  E10  the page writes text, never markup or code: no innerHTML/outerHTML/insertAdjacentHTML/createContextualFragment,
       DOMParser, eval (called in any way), new Function, document.write, string timers, script elements made from
       the script, and no on...= handlers or javascript: addresses in the markup (read as tags, so a question that
       happens to contain "only =" is not a handler). "eval" means the name anywhere in the page's script — eval(…),
       (0, eval)(…), window.eval(…); a name put together while the page runs is not something a reading can see, and
       the policy, which allows no string to run as code, stops it in the browser
  E11  colours come from the design tokens: no hex, rgb() or hsl() in the page's own styles, inline styles, SVG
       colour attributes or scripts, and no named colours in its styles
  E12  no icon characters in the page or its concept: emoji, dingbats, geometric shapes and the other pictograph
       blocks, the emoji punctuation marks and the info sign (‼ ⁉ ℹ), a keycap, and anything followed by the emoji
       selector (U+FE0F). Arrows (→ ↔), and © ® ™, are text and allowed. Icons are line SVG
  E13  the footer says what the formula leaves out, where it comes from, and that the page is not advice
  E14  the page reads its concept block, carries its ?probe=1 battery, and its <title> is the concept's title

What this does not check: that the controls are wired to the formula, that the numbers on the page are right, and
that the practice questions grade as they promise. That needs the page running — probe_check.py.
